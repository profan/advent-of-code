# advent-of-code-2015
The intention is to use a new language for each day of the 2015 [challenge](http://adventofcode.com/) which runs throughout December until the 25th, two each day, making a total of 50 challenges.

Another friend of mine is also doing a similar thing, so czech it out: https://github.com/hexpunK/adventcode-2015
Ideally, the languages would be as distinct from each-other as possible, to which extent this will be possible is yet to be seen. (my Prolog is a bit rusty...)

## Languages
**1st. [Racket](http://www.racket-lang.org/)** - [[Part 1](1-1.rkt), [Part 2](1-2.rkt)] - [Not Quite Lisp](http://adventofcode.com/day/1)
